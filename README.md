***So this was the project we have created with our efforts. We have added the screenshots for our audience to understand easily.***

# challenges to build this website
1. The original website was not built on the React framework, due to which we were not getting any idea how many components should be broken into the whole website but we were taught by Masai school so didn't face much problem and we broke it into components according to our own.

2. The biggest challenge we faced was to connect the backend server and frontend server together which we were doing for the first time but we were successful in that and successfully connected both the services.

3. We had received the layout of the entire website in the form of a figma file by our designer colleagues, which we had to clone, so there was some problem in using the figma file but with the help of designer colleagues, we completed it successfully.

**These challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player and finally we did the constitution of all the problems together and made our perfect project.**
